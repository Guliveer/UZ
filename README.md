# This repo is a collection of all the programming assignments I've completed during my studies on the [University of Zielona Góra](https://uz.zgora.pl/en/) since October 2023

❓ If you don't understand something - try to translate it from polish 🇵🇱

📝 *Comments I've left for my friends to learn coding might be appearing.*

## Directory tree naming logic:
`/R_S_/[subject]/somewhat_organized_assignments_in_subdirs/`

- `R_` -> year of studying, where _ represents a number of given year
- `S_` -> semester of the year, where _ represents a number in range {1,2}
- `[subject]` -> name of the subject; letter in brackets defines the type of classes in a given subject: *L* - practical, *Ć* - practical (more focused on math without computers), *W* - lectures
