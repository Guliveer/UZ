# Django project

## Task

Create a Django project that must include (quotes):

- login and registration functionality
- something for user to do after login
- admins can do _âœ¨something moreâœ¨_ than regular users

## Result

An application for users to create, edit, and delete notes.  
Users can register, log in, and manage their notes. Admin users can delete any note (stupid requirement of making admins do \*_something more_\*) and users.
